*** Version 3-2-0-0-Beta
*** Version 3-2-0-1-Beta (08.02.2013 - rev308)
ADDED: LoadBalancingClient.createRoomFromMy - uses properties (except name) of current room for room creation request
ADDED: PhotonPeer.StatusCodes.connectClosed - connection closed by server as opposed to StatusCodes.disconnect by client

*** Version 3-2-1-1 (11.04.2013 - rev317)
ADDED: LoadBalancingClient.joinRandomRoom expectedCustomRoomProperties and expectedMaxPlayers parameters
BREAKING: LoadBalancingClient.joinRandomRoom matchingType parameter order changed
ADDED: LoadBalancing.Room setIsVisible, setIsOpen, setMaxPlayers methods for updating standard room properties while joined
FIXED: LoadBalancingClient.myRoomActors initialized with local client before connection and after disconnect
CHANGED: LoadBalancingClient.changeState calls moved below client state update in handlers for user could use new states in onStateChange 
RENAMED: LoadBalancingClient.isConnectedToGame -> isJoinedToRoom
FIXED: loadBalancingClient.isConnectedToMaster() means masterPeer.isConnected (true all the way while connected to master)
FIXED: state -> ConnectedToMaster on OperationCode.Authenticate response; state  -> JoinedLobby on OperationCode.JoinLobby response (was ConnectedToMaster)
BREAKING: previous fix can break code relying on ConnectedToMaster state - replace it with JoinedLobby
ADDED: LoadBalancingClient.isInLobby - ready to join or create game
CHANGED: LoadBalancingClient.raiseEvent data parameter is optional
ADDED: LoadBalancingClient.leaveRoom: after disconnecting from game, reconnects to master if not connected
CHANGED: LoadBalancingClient.state = JoinedLobby after disconnect from game if still connected to master (via keepMasterConnection = true)

*** Version 3-2-1-2 (01.07.2013 - rev330)
ADDED: Custom Authentication 
CHANGED: app settings template replaced with working cloud-app-info.js file with default demo master server = app-eu.exitgamescloud.com:9090
ADDED: compiled js files, so one can use the project as javascript sdk, without need of typescript compiler 
ADDED: proxy Photon-Javascript_SDK.d.ts file; demos reference lib sources in development same way as they reference release libs in production
